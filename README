pinax-groups-experiments: 
experiments with pinax/groups and the pinax/sample_group_project 
to add a new feature, try a variation, and improve navbars.

This project is just an experiment.  It does not pretend to be the best way
to implement this stuff.  But it does mostly work.

This is a pinax project, dependent on (and runs with) pinax 0.7 or 0.7.1.
You must have one of those pinax bases installed in a virtualenv 
and activated.

NEW FEATURE:  
Nested groups, in this case company/projects/tasks,
where a Company (a Group) can have Projects (other groups) which have Tasks.

These are ~not~ infinitely nested groups.  Will only work for 2 levels.

VARIATION:
A content app (economic_events) where each content app instance is related
to two different groups (companies).

NAVBAR IMPROVEMENTS:
* Project/tasks retains the Project maintab hilite
* Likewise Company/Project/Tasks retains the Company maintab hilite
* Subnav selections are hilit
