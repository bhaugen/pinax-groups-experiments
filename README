pinax_groups_experiments: experiments with pinax/groups and the pinax/sample_group_project 
to add a newfeature, try a variation, and improve navbars

NEW FEATURE:  
Nested groups, in this case company/projects/tasks,
where a Company (a Group) can have Projects (other groups) which have Tasks.

VARIATION:
A content app (economic_events) where each content app instance is related
to two different groups (companies).

NAVBAR IMPROVEMENTS:
* Project/tasks retains the Project maintab hilite
* Likewise Company/Project/Tasks retains the Company maintab hilite
* Subnav selections are hilit
